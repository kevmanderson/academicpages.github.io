I'm a cognitive neuroscientist working with [Avram Holmes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EhyhJkwAAAAJ) at [Yale University](http://holmeslab.yale.edu/). My research investigates how human behavior is shaped by biology. Specifically, I integrate genetic, transcriptional, and neuroimaging data to create biologically grounded models of brain function and behavior. Ultimately this work aims to inform our understanding of heritable forms of psychiatric illness. 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate int the Department of Psychology at Yale. Prior to New Haven, I worked as a research assistant with [David Zald](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jYZHAO0AAAAJ&hl=en) at Vanderbilt University and an IRTA post-baccalaureate fellow with [Alex Martin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F-PdhBgAAAAJ&hl=en) at the National Institute of Mental Health. I studied psychology at the University of New Hampshire and am from Portsmouth, NH.
