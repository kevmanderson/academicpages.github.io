I'm a cognitive neuroscientist working with [(Avram Holmes)](http://holmeslab.yale.edu/) at Yale University. My research investigates how human behavior is shaped by biology. Specifically, I integrate genetic, transcriptional, and neuroimaging data to create biologically grounded models of brain function and behavior. Ultimately this work aims to inform our understanding of heritable forms of psychiatric illness. 

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate int the Department of Psychology at Yale. Prior to New Haven, I worked as a research assistant with David Zald at Vanderbilt University and an IRTA post-baccalaureate fellow with Alex Martin at the National Institute of Mental Health. I studied psychology at the University of New Hampshire and am from Portsmouth, NH.
